# TownSquareProject
Current TODO List: <br>
12 Oct 2018:<br>
<br>
--All the hanging signs still need to go in <br>
--graphics for the sandwich board signs <br>
--texture for the stairs <br>
--randomizing the doors and windows for the houses <br>
--populating the flower beds with mushrooms/succulents/flowers <br>
--making the floor/ground <br>
--fx for smoke coming out of chimneys, maybe some fireflies <br>
--collision boxes (there is a collison box around the entire outside so that you shouldn't be able to fall out, and one on the wagon and stairs) <br>
--Populating the outer ring of the houses <br>
--BAKING all the lights (currently set to realtime. Nothing really moves, it's just set to realtime for now while I get everything figured out) <br>
--Adding more lights for a more directional flow (I wanted the bakery to be the first stop, but because of the candle light on the wagon, you end up going there first) <br>
--Adding ambient sound <br>
--Adding in code to escape when pressing esc key (I know this is like two lines of code and I'm honestly not sure why I haven't put it in yet. It's usually the first thing I do) <br>
--animating a camera for a walkthrough (for demo reel) <br>
<br>
<br>
--I'm sure lots of other things...and there are things that I'd like to go back and add to or improve, but I want to get this done(ish), so I can work on my next projects/scenes and then circle back to this one as time allows. <br>
--In case you were curious, there are 142 unique meshes. Most of the textures are 2048, and the only things that are on texture maps by themselves are the wagon and clocktower. EVERYTHING else, shares a texture map. <br>
--Oh. and the clocktower can be viewed on sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/models/5d53c21387fa4c6eb10ab786da27852e <br>
